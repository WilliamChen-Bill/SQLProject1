# SQLProject: Manipulating Matrices and Analyzing Sales Data 

This repository contains solutions to a problem set I completed using SQL queries and Python. The problem set consisted of three main parts:

1. **Linear Algebra with SQL**: I worked with two 3x3 matrices and used SQL queries to perform various linear algebra operations, such as matrix addition, dot product calculation, matrix multiplication, and matrix power calculation. 

2. **Sales Data Analysis**: In this part, I used a sales dataset and wrote SQL queries to find store(s) with the highest sales during holiday weeks, count non-holiday weeks with larger sales than the average sales during holiday weeks, and calculate total summer sales for each type of store.

3. **The Traveling SQL Server Salesman Problem**: Here, I used a table of streets connecting company office buildings and solved a few problems related to a traveling salesperson using SQL queries. 

To run these queries, I first loaded the required databases into the IPython notebook using the `%load_ext sql` extension and `%sql sqlite:///hw1.db` magic command.

Each problem in the problem set is followed by the SQL query I used to solve it, along with the output I obtained.

## Prerequisites

- Python
- IPython
- SQL
- SQLite
- Basic understanding of SQL queries and Python

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Open the IPython notebook in a Python environment.
3. Make sure to have the required databases (hw1.db) in the same directory.

## Usage

Go through the IPython notebook and take a look at the problem statements, the SQL queries used to solve them, and the output obtained. 

Note: The SQL queries are written in a way that they should work for all inputs of the given type, not just the example inputs provided in the problem statements.
